## Overview

Standard neural networks are overconfident by design - their softmax outputs are routinely miscalibrated, assigning high confidence to incorrect predictions and low confidence to correct ones. This becomes critical in deployment: a model that cannot self-assess its own uncertainty is not safe to trust.

This project provides:

1. A **rigorous comparative evaluation** of four established UQ methods (MSP Baseline, MC Dropout, Evidential Deep Learning, Deep Ensembles) on CIFAR-10 (in-distribution) vs CIFAR-100 (out-of-distribution).
2. A **novel unsupervised confidence metric** that estimates model confidence using only the model's own internal signals - no labels, no human annotation, no held-out data required.
3. **Comprehensive ablation studies** validating every component of the proposed metric.

**Benchmark:** CIFAR-10 (ID) vs CIFAR-100 (OOD) · 100 training epochs · 10 classes

---

## Motivation

Uncertainty quantification in deep learning is a well-studied problem, but existing approaches share a fundamental limitation: **evaluation requires labels**. In real-world deployment - medical imaging, autonomous systems, financial prediction - you rarely have access to ground truth at inference time.

The core question driving this work:

> *Can we construct a confidence signal that correlates with true model errors, using only the model's own outputs and representations?*

This project answers yes - and demonstrates it empirically across four different UQ architectures.

---

## Novel Contribution

### Unsupervised Confidence Metric

The proposed metric combines four label-free signals into a unified confidence score:

| Component | What It Captures |
|---|---|
| **Prediction Consistency** | Stability of predictions across augmented views of the same input |
| **Entropy-Based Uncertainty** | Information-theoretic uncertainty from the output distribution |
| **Feature Space Dispersion** | Spread of representations in the penultimate layer |
| **Softmax Temperature Analysis** | Sharpness of the output distribution under temperature scaling |

**Key result:** The metric achieves Spearman correlations of up to **ρ = 0.4221** with true model errors - without using a single label. Q4 accuracy (confidence in the top quartile of predictions) reaches **99.92%** under MC Dropout.

| Method | Spearman ρ ↑ | Q4 Accuracy ↑ |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline | 0.4115 | 99.68% |
| MC Dropout | **0.4221** | **99.92%** |
| Evidential | 0.3708 | 98.60% |
| Ensemble | 0.4127 | 99.68% |

The metric is **architecture-agnostic** - it plugs into any of the four UQ methods evaluated here without modification.

---

## Methods

### 1. Baseline - Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP)
Uses the maximum softmax output as a proxy for confidence. Fast, parameter-free, and a strong baseline despite its simplicity. Achieves competitive OOD detection (AUROC 0.8549) at near-zero inference overhead (0.25ms).

### 2. Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout)
Treats dropout as approximate Bayesian inference. Runs N stochastic forward passes at test time, using variance across passes as the uncertainty estimate. Best calibration in the benchmark (ECE: **0.0097**) - an order of magnitude better than other methods - at the cost of higher inference time (5.40ms).

### 3. Evidential Deep Learning (EDL)
Places a Dirichlet distribution over the softmax outputs, modeling second-order uncertainty from a single forward pass. Achieves the **highest accuracy (91.66%)** in the benchmark. Uncertainty is derived from the concentration parameters of the learned Dirichlet, not from stochastic sampling.

### 4. Deep Ensembles
Trains multiple independent models and uses disagreement across predictions as the uncertainty signal. Matches Baseline on AUROC and accuracy while providing well-calibrated ensemble uncertainty. Higher compute at training time; moderate inference overhead (0.85ms).

## Results

### Classification Performance

| Method | Accuracy ↑ | ECE ↓ | OOD AUROC ↑ | Inference (ms) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline (MSP) | 91.14% | 0.0323 | **0.8549** | 0.25 |
| MC Dropout | 90.78% | **0.0097** | 0.8531 | 5.40 |
| Evidential (EDL) | **91.66%** | 0.0742 | 0.8440 | 0.25 |
| Deep Ensemble | 91.14% | 0.0323 | 0.8549 | 0.85 |

### Key Findings

- **Best Accuracy:** Evidential Deep Learning - 91.66%
- **Best Calibration:** MC Dropout - ECE of 0.0097 (3× lower than the next best)
- **Best OOD Detection:** Baseline & Ensemble - AUROC 0.8549
- **Best Unsupervised Metric Correlation:** MC Dropout - ρ = 0.4221
- **Fastest Inference:** Baseline & Evidential - 0.25ms per sample

### Practical Takeaway

No single method dominates across all axes. MC Dropout is the best overall uncertainty estimator (calibration + unsupervised metric) at the cost of 20× inference overhead. Evidential Deep Learning is the strongest single-model classifier with no inference penalty. Ensembles offer a calibration-accuracy balance at moderate cost.

## Usage

Open `unsupervised_confidence_estimation.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code and run cells sequentially. The `main_pipeline()` function orchestrates the full experiment.

```python
models, results, unsupervised_results, evaluator = main_pipeline(
    train_models=False,     # set True to retrain from scratch
    num_epochs=100,
    run_ablations=True,
    id_dataset='cifar10',
    ood_dataset='cifar100',
    batch_size=128
)
```

**Flags:**
- `train_models=False` - loads pretrained checkpoints from `checkpoints/`, skips retraining
- `run_ablations=True` - runs full ablation suite on the unsupervised metric
- `FAST_DEBUG_SUBSET=1` (env var) or `--smoke-test` flag - runs on a data subset for quick validation

---

## Ablation Studies

Three ablation axes validate the design of the unsupervised confidence metric:

| Ablation | Variable | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| Dropout Rate | MC Dropout inference stochasticity | Optimal range: 0.1–0.3 |
| Ensemble Size | Number of ensemble members | Diminishing returns beyond 5 |
| Component Weights | Relative contribution of each metric signal | Entropy + consistency dominate |
